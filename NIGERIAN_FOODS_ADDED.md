## Product Images

✅ **All products now have placeholder images!**

The products currently use high-quality placeholder images from picsum.photos with unique seeds for each product. While these provide a professional appearance, you may want to replace them with authentic Nigerian food photos.

### To Replace with Authentic Nigerian Food Images:

#### Option 1: Via Sanity Studio (Recommended)

1. **Open Sanity Studio** in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/studio
   ```

2. **Sign in** with your Sanity credentials

3. **Navigate to Products** section

4. **Click on any product** to edit

5. **Upload images**:
   - Click the "Images" field
   - Click "Upload" or drag and drop images
   - You can add multiple images per product
   - Click "Publish" to save

### Option 2: Upload Nigerian Food Images

You can download authentic Nigerian raw food images from:
- **Pexels**: https://www.pexels.com/search/nigerian%20food/
- **Unsplash**: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/african-vegetables
- **Pixabay**: https://pixabay.com/images/search/african%20food/
- Local food markets (take your own photos)

**Recommended**: Use real photos of Nigerian food items for authenticity!

### Option 3: Bulk Upload via Script

If you have local images, I can create a script to upload them in bulk.

## Viewing Products on Frontend

1. **Start your development server** (if not running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Visit** http://localhost:3000

3. **Browse products** - All 22 Nigerian raw foods should appear on the homepage

4. **Filter by category** - Use the category pills to filter by:
   - Tubers & Roots
   - Vegetables
   - Grains & Cereals
   - Legumes & Beans
   - Spices & Seasonings
   - Fruits

## Product Features

Each product includes:
- ✓ Name (English and local names)
- ✓ Price in Naira (₦)
- ✓ Detailed description
- ✓ Category classification
- ✓ Stock quantity
- ✓ Rating
- ✓ Badges (Fresh, Popular, Premium, etc.)
- ✓ Featured status

## Next Steps

1. **Add Images**: Upload real Nigerian food images via Sanity Studio
2. **Adjust Prices**: Update prices based on current market rates
3. **Add More Products**: Use the admin panel or Sanity Studio to add more items
4. **Update Descriptions**: Enhance product descriptions with more details

## Re-running the Script

To clear and re-populate (if needed):

1. **Delete existing products** in Sanity Studio
2. **Run script again**:
   ```bash
   npm run populate:foods
   ```

**Note**: The script will create duplicates if run multiple times without clearing existing data.

## Admin Panel

Access the admin panel at http://localhost:3000/admin to:
